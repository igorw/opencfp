            <p>
                As a community-driven conference, we are interested in a wide variety of
                topics related to PHP and tools commonly used by PHP developers. There's
                no reason to not submit a talk: the worst thing that will happen is that
                we will say "that's an awesome talk, we just can't fit it in!"
            </p>
            <p>
                With the addition of a tutorial day to the 2013 edition we are looking for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Full-day tutorials (6 hours)</li>
                    <li>Half-day tutorials (3 hours)</li>
                    <li>Regular sessions (50 minutes including Q&A)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                As with last year's conference, our venue is Microsoft Canada's offices
                near Highway 401 and Mississauga Road, just west of Pearson International Airport (YYZ).
                Coffee, tea, drinks and lunch will be provided at no extra cost to attendees.
            </p>
            <p>
                All accepted speakers will have as much of their travel & accommodation expenses covered
                as possible by the conference (for reference all 2012 speakers who required reimbursement
                had 100% of their expenses covered).
            </p>
            <p>
                These include travel from your location to
                Pearson International Airport, transportation to the venue and up to 3 nights hotel accommodation at a
                hotel within walking distance of the venue.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you or your employer can cover your expenses, we are happy to extend
                an offer to be a bronze-level sponsor of the conference in exchange for the
                generosity.

                True North PHP is committed to creating a conference that is inclusive as possible.
                We want to showcase the talent available in Canada along with fostering beginning
                speakers. We are also happy to welcome international speakers, but the numbers
                are limited to our ability to cover expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place
                where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together, new friends meet and harassment
                is not tolerated. We expect speakers and attendees to be professional and courteous to
                each other. We reserve the right to remove from the venue without refund ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise)
                who is unable to adhere to these ideals.
            </p>
            <p>
                We look forward to seeing what ideas you want to share with us this year!
